## Software Engineer 
Hey there! 👋
I'm Josh, a software developer by day, bug hunter by night. I write code that usually works, and when it doesn’t, I call it “experimental features.”<br>

About Me:<br>
🌱  Currently learning C# and Angular.js —or at least pretending to.<br>
🚀  I’m looking to collaborate on any Javascript related project.<br>
💬 Ask me about backend development, API design and vanilla Javascript. I promise I won't just Google the answer... probably<br>
📫 How to reach me: joshblazerwillie@gmail.com<br>
⚡ Fun fact: I once solved a bug by adding a semicolon. <br>
