# JoshBlazer
Hey there! 👋
I'm Josh, a software developer by day, bug hunter by night. I write code that usually works, and when it doesn’t, I call it “experimental features.”

About Me:
🌱  Currently learning C# and Angular.js —or at least pretending to.
🚀  I’m looking to collaborate on any Javascript related project.
💬 Ask me about backend development, API design, vanilla Javascript. I promise I won't just Google the answer... probably
📫 How to reach me: joshblazerwillie@gmail.com
⚡ Fun fact: I once solved a bug by adding a semicolon. 

Skills:
Proficient in JavaScript, Python, Node.js, SQL and occasionally proficient in magic when code works on the first try.
Experienced with  React and Django
Strong problem-solving skills.


Interests:
Exploring new technologies, occasionally over-optimizing things for fun.
Contributing to open-source projects and figuring out how to explain my code to a rubber duck.
Continuous learning, mostly so I can fix what I broke yesterday.
